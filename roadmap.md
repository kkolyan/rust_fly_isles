# Roadmap

## [WIP] Technical readiness
All technical features are ready - need just to configure sheets for weapons, mobs, levels

* [x] adjust color of mobs (maybe via HSV-RGB conversion and overriding Hue)
* [ ] Loot dropped from killed enemies
* [ ] adjustable turn limit for a flying mob to be able to configure enemy planes that could be won by outmaneuvering

## [PENDING] Demo
Full game experience, but content only for an hour of play
